       <p>We go to east Loddon p-12 College and have gone there for our entire schooling carers. That means we have been here for the last 11 years of our life and have seen this school change a lot, including in the ways of technology. That is why we think it is important to learn the most current technological skills, since the world is changing constantly.</p>
       <p>
         The class that has allowed us to create this project is our advance class. It is meant to teach us leadership and teamwork skills, and to give us practice at creating and organisation our own projects. Just like the case of our Loddon footprint project.
